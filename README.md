## 🎨 Phase 2 — Redesign Using Therapist Profile

The cloned homepage was redesigned using **Dr. Maya Reynolds, PsyD (fictional therapist)** as the single source of truth for all content.

### Content Changes
- Rewrote all homepage copy (headings, descriptions, CTAs)
- Content strictly derived from the therapist’s profile:
  - Anxiety & panic
  - Trauma & EMDR
  - Burnout and high-pressure professionals
- Copy written in a **calm, trauma-informed, non-salesy tone**
- SEO-optimized for **Santa Monica, CA**

### Design Changes
- Replaced the original lilac color palette with a new cohesive theme
- Introduced CSS variables for maintainable theming
- Updated typography to reflect a professional therapy practice
- Replaced all template images with intentional, relevant visuals

### Design Intent
The redesign focuses on:
- Trust
- Clarity
- Emotional safety
- Professional restraint
